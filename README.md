# Infinite City Motion | webGL Shader

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/pjkarlik/pen/wvmKevN](https://codepen.io/pjkarlik/pen/wvmKevN).

Doing some simple domain repetition and offset timing. The building texture is just some simple noise/hash values based on the hitpoint.

Was trying to write a compact and small shader example. 

All code in HTML window (GLSL fragment Shader)
Bootstrap using TWGL.js (in js window + custom mouse class)
